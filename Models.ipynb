Sufferfest was a software product that competed directly with Zwift and Tr ainerRoad, some of Wahoo’s long-term partners. At that time, Zwift announced that it would start to build its own hardware products, including indoor trainers. “We think that Sufferfest is different from everything that is out there,” Closs said. “It un iquely blends content and structured training workouts in a way that is different from anything else in the industry.” 7 Outdoor bicycles were attached to these devices enabling riders to train indoors. 8 An indoor trainer was a product that conne cted to a cyclist’s regular bi cycle to turn it into a stationary bicycle. A smart in door trainer allowed theor glasses. Some in the industry were exploring clothing items such as smart shirts, sh oes, socks, hats, or pants that could track athlete performance.30 Consumer Survey To keep pace with competitors as well as grow beyond them, Wahoo had several areas to consider. Customers wanted easy-to-use devices, innovation, and functionality. Additionally, “we want to create a more seamless experience,” Closs said. Wahoo collected produc t, website, and social media data. “We leverage data on our apps to better understand our customers and to crea te better products,” Closs said, “and do better cross-selling.” As the team considered growth, Wahoo decide d to conduct a survey to g ather data and ultimately improve its strategy, consumer targeting, marketing plans, and innovation pipeline.
