Sufferfest was a software product that competed directly with Zwift and Tr ainerRoad, some of Wahoo’s long-term partners. At that time, Zwift announced that it would start to build its own hardware products, including indoor trainers. “We think that Sufferfest is different from everything that is out there,” Closs said. “It un iquely blends content and structured training workouts in a way that is different from anything else in the industry.” 7 Outdoor bicycles were attached to these devices enabling riders to train indoors. 8 An indoor trainer was a product that conne cted to a cyclist’s regular bi cycle to turn it into a stationary bicycle. A smart in door trainer allowed theor glasses. Some in the industry were exploring clothing items such as smart shirts, sh oes, socks, hats, or pants that could track athlete performance.30 Consumer Survey To keep pace with competitors as well as grow beyond them, Wahoo had several areas to consider.

The auto takeback proposal was actually the first of several initiatives that would also affect the end-of-life (EOL) treatment of such other products as household appliances and consumer electronics.

The machine depreciation charges on the two process trains were broken out separately, as deter-mined at the time the machinery was purchased. For exam-ple, the General process train originally cost $500,000 ten years ago and had an expected life of five years, or about 10,000 hours, hence its depreciation rate of $50 per hour. The Analysis Meredith was able to consolidate all of the information she collected into a spreadsheet. Making what she fell were THE BMW COMPANY Late in the summer of 1989, the government of Germany was seriously considering an innovative policy affecting the treatment of scrapped vehicles. This policy would make auto manufacturers responsible for recycling and disposal of their vehicles at the end of their useful lives. Sometimes referred to as a \"Producer Responsibility\" policy, this regulation would obligate the manufacturers of automobiles to take back vehicles that were ready to be scrapped. The auto takeback proposal was actually theover the previous several years, having consolidated its position in the marketplace. Long-range forecasts pre-dicted that the economy would grow by about 2 percent in the coming decade, with inflation at no more than 4 percent. However, the proposed takeback policy raised questions about whether the company\\'s profitability could endure. Assuming that, in the new regulatory regime, automakers bear the cost of disposal, the Lask is to estimate how much of the firm\\'s net income will be devoted to EOL vehicles 10 years into the future.
