The machine depreciation charges on the two process trains were broken out separately, as deter-mined at the time the machinery was purchased. For exam-ple, the General process train originally cost $500,000 ten years ago and had an expected life of five years, or about 10,000 hours, hence its depreciation rate of $50 per hour. The Analysis Meredith was able to consolidate all of the information she collected into a spreadsheet. Making what she fell were THE BMW COMPANY Late in the summer of 1989, the government of Germany was seriously considering an innovative policy affecting the treatment of scrapped vehicles. This policy would make auto manufacturers responsible for recycling and disposal of their vehicles at the end of their useful lives. Sometimes referred to as a \"Producer Responsibility\" policy, this regulation would obligate the manufacturers of automobiles to take back vehicles that were ready to be scrapped. The auto takeback proposal was actually the first of several initiatives that would also affect the end-of-life (EOL) treatment of such other products as household appliances and consumer electronics. But in 1989, no other industry had faced anything like this new policy. Managers at BMW and other German automakers struggled to under-stand the implications for their own company. Perhaps the first exercise was to gauge the magnitude of the economic effect. Stated another way, management wanted to know what the cost o( the new policy was likely to be, if BMW continued to do business as usual. Background A loose net work of dismantlers and shredders managed most of the recycling and disposal of German vehicles, accounting for about 95 percent of EOL volume, or roughly 2.1 million vehicles per year. Dismantling was a labor-intensive process that removed auto parts, fluids, and materials that could be THE BMW COMPANY 451 reasonable assumptions about relevant cost factors, she was able to optimize the production plan, and she deter-mined that it should be possible to meet the 25 percent profitability target. Nevertheless, there seemed to be several factors in it that were subject to change-things that had come up in her various conversations, such as maintenance, warehousing, and the possibility of modifying the contract. She expected that Mr. Cox would quiz her about all of these factors, and she knew it would be important for her to be prepared for his questions. \nowned businesses, the costs of dismantling and shredding would ultimately be borne by the auto companies, since the policy made them legally responsible for the waste. Economics of disposal The costs in this system had been increasing and, in fact, were about to increase more quickly due to two major trends, one involving disposal costs and the other involving material composition. On the material side, automobiles were being designed with less metal each year and more plastics. ln the 1960s, a typical car was made up of more than 80 percent metal, but the new models of 1990 were only about 75 percent metal. This meant that more of the vehicle was destined to end up as ASR. Averaged across the market, autos weighed an average of about 1,000 kg each. See Exhibit 1 for some representative figures. Exhibit 1. Material Trends in Automobile Composition Material 1965 1985 1995 (est.)

The hulk that remained was sold to a shredder. BMW 1989 Models Weight (kg) Plastics Content Shredding was a capital-intensive business that separated the remaining materials into distinct streams. Ferrous metals were sold to steel producers, nonferrous metals were sold to specialized metal companies, and the remaining material was typically sent to landfills or incinerators. The material headed for disposal was known as Automobile Shredder Residue (ASR) and consisted of plastic, rubber, foam, glass, and dirt. ASR was virtually impossible to separate into portions with any economic value, so shredders paid for its removal and disposal. As of 1989, the annual volume of ASR came to about 400,000 tons. On average, an automobile stayed in service for about 10 years. Although dismantlers and shredders were unaffiliated, private businesses in 1989, it was conceivable that, under the new government policy, they would be taken over by the auto companies. Even if they remained independently 3 series 5 series 7 series 1, 150 1,400 1,650 11.3% 10.9% 10.3% On the disposal side, a much more significant trend was in progress. As in most of Europe, landfill options were dis-appearing in Germany. In 1989, about half of the waste stream found its way to landfills, with 35 perce11t going to waste-to-energy incinerators, and the remaining 15 percent to recycling of some kind. But the number of landfills was declining, and it looked like this trend would continue, so that by 1999 landfill and incineration would handle approxi-mately equal shares. The effects of supply and demand were visible in the costs of disposal at landfills. Exhibit 2 sum-marizes recent and projected costs. \n\n452 MODELING CASES Exhibit 2.

Recent envir-onmental regulations were beginning Lo restrict the materi-als that could be taken to landfills. and there was a good chance that ASR would be prohibited. Specially designed hazardous waste landfills were an alternative, but they tended to be three or four times as costly as the typical solid-waste landfill. Meanwhile. the number of incinerators had grown from a handful in the early 1960s lo nearly 50 by 1989, with pro-spects for another 25 or more in the coming decade. How-ever, incinerators were expensive to build, and awareness of their environmental impacts was growing. In particular, the incineration of plastics had come under special scrutiny. The net effect was that incineration was about twice as costly as landfill disposal in 1989. and it was uncertain how the relative cost of incineration would evolve in the years to come. Trends in the Market Prior to the 1980s, BMW cars were known for their reliability and quality. Only during the 80s did BMW acquire a reputation (or performance and begin to com-pete in the high-end market. As a result, its domestic market share had risen from about 5.6 percent at the start of the decade to 6.7 percent in 1989. Some details of financial and market performance for BMW are summar-ized in Exhibits 3 and 4. In 1989, BMW seemed poised to benefit from its suc-cesses over the previous several years, having consolidated its position in the marketplace. Long-range forecasts pre-dicted that the economy would grow by about 2 percent in the coming decade, with inflation at no more than 4 percent. However, the proposed takeback policy raised questions about whether the company's profitability could endure. Assuming that, in the new regulatory regime, automakers bear the cost of disposal, the Lask is to estimate how much of the firm's net income will be devoted to EOL vehicles 10 years into the future.

Further-more, these inefficiencies were beginning to cause many companies to lose ground to other, better-organized firms. At the same time, enterprise resource planning (ERP) software, especially SAP R/3 (hllp://www.sap.com/), was reaching a high state of maturity as its penetration rate among the Fortune 1000 rose. The decision whether to convert to SAP (or a competing product) was a strategic one for many companies at this time, both because of the 6.7% 180,200 6.4% 1.7% 153,100 1.9% 6.4% 78,800 6.8% 1.1% 47,700 1.1% \nhigh costs and risks of cost overruns (many SAP imple-mentations had failed or been far more costly than expected) and because of the high risks of 1101 implement-ing integrated software.

Mar. 24, 2023 \nWahoo Fitness: Segmentation and Data Insights \nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a ma jor impact on the personal fitness industry throughout 2020.1 \u201cIndoor \ntraining had been slowly growing, but the shift indoors due to lockdowns really tipped the scale,\u201d said John \nCloss, head of business insights at Wahoo Fitness (Wahoo) in Atlanta, Georgia. \u201cIt got more people into cycling.\u201d As a result, Wahoo\u2019s sales skyrocketed; by spring 2021, it was still catching up on the backlog. \nOne month before the impact of the coronavirus clos ed businesses in the United States, Wahoo launched \nits first watch\u2014the Elemnt Rival GPS smartwatch. The watch catered to triathletes and included specific features for them. For example, it was the first smartwatch to include touchless transition for triathletes. It was able to identify shifts between swimming, cycling, and running, and to automatically switch modes. In summer \n2021, the Elemnt Rival watch was featured among the best men\u2019s cycling gear of the year.\n2 \nCloss and the team at Wahoo were excited about the potential of this new category. It was the entryway \ninto a market valued at $19 billion in 2020 and projected to grow at a CAGR of 38.6% over the next six years.3 \nThe company turned to its roots\u2014data insights. Closs and the team started with qualitative data surveys to \nidentify customer segments and extract insights into ot her market opportunities. \u201cW ahoo still had a relatively \nlow awareness,\u201d Closs said. \u201cRight now, if you don\u2019t consider yourself a cyclist, you are probably not a Wahoo \ncustomer.\u201d The data uncovered potential sports activity customer segments\u2014competitive, social, and leisure. Then they asked what that would mean for Wahoo. Was now the time to engage with cycling hobbyists or \nleisure cyclists? Or did it make sense to expand on the initial success of the smartwatch and offer more products \nin the running segment? The option to leverage Wahoo\u2019s expertise in software and add more tracker features \nmight also be attractive. \n1 This is a field-based case.

Hawkins and his \npartner led a turnaround at Wahoo Docks as business grew year over year. The water-dock industry heavily \nrelied on new construction and sales of new houses. With the real estate  market crash in 2008, Wahoo Docks \nwent from doubling sales yea r over year to flat growth. \nWith the slowdown in the water-dock business, Hawkins found himself with more free time. His wife \nconvinced him to sign up for a duathlon. Although he was a water sports enthusiast, Hawkins had not done \nmuch cardio exercise up to that point and had to quit midway through the first race. That experience motivated \nhim to get serious about physical fitness. He bought better equipment and started training. \nMotivated by his time training, Hawkins eventually go t into triathlons. His engineering background instilled \nin him the importance of data and validation. Cyclists mainly relied on five data categories: distance  and elevation \nhelped cyclists understand how far they pedaled and at what steepness (called gradient); speed informed cyclists \nof how fast they moved (but it was not a good indication of effort, since ri ding downhill was easier than riding \nuphill); heart rate  helped cyclists understand how ha rd their bodies were working; and power\u2014perhaps the most \nunique, yet important, data for cyclists\u2014allowed cyclists to measure their effort in a reliable and consistent way. Power, or the amount of energy used over time, was me asured in watts and was consistent even over widely \ndifferent road gradients and wind conditions; as such, it was key to training. Combining the five sets of data, a \ncyclist was able to know their distance, power, speed, elevation, and heart rate at any exact point in time. \nWhile training, Hawkins relied on a Garmin bike computer for distance and speed data but had to use \nanother device for power data. Merging data between devices was a challenge. Additionally, it was a hassle to \nupload data into his computer and impossible to upload it to his smartphone. Hawkins knew he could build a \nbetter product. He started building an adapter that allowed a sensor to connect to a smartphone. The co-owner of Wahoo Docks became the founder of Wahoo Fitness in November 2009. \nWahoo\u2019s first success \nRunning and cycling apps were already prominent in a pp stores and widely used by 2010 (e.g., Runkeeper, \nMapmyride, Strava). Since one of the most common requests from app customers was the ability to track and upload heart rate data to their phones, Hawkins built a wireless Ant+\n5 system key adapter that would connect \nheart rate monitors and other wireless health and fitness devices to a smartphone. In search of a partnership for the new Ant+ adapter technology, Wahoo reached out to contacts at Apple. Although the company was \nuninterested, a contact there shared a vague hint that a new technology had just been released in one of its new \ndevices that might be of interest. Hawkins browsed on line and discovered that the newly released MacBook \nAir included Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology.\n6 The BLE technology was not ad vertised at all by Apple. \nIf Apple implemented the BLE technology in the iPhone, it would completely disrupt Wahoo\u2019s core product, \nwhich used the Ant+ system. Hawkins and his team decided to bet that the next iPhone, the iPhone 4S, would \n4 The material in this section draws heavil y from two podcast interviews with Chip Ha wkins: \u201cChip Hawkins North of Atlanta, Geor gia,\u201d July 7, 2019, \nin Home Roads, hosted by Matt Barbet, podcast, MP3 audio, 32:17, https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podca st/chip-hawkins-north-of-atlanta-\ngeorgia/id1390742483?i=1000443879801; and Triathlon Taren Podcast, epis ode \u201cWahoo Fitness Founder Chip Hawk ins on: Starting Businesses, the \nFuture of Bike Tech, and Taking Ri sks,\u201d October 1, 2017, in Taren\u2019s M \u014dTTIV Method Podcast hosted by Taren Gesell, podcast, MP3 audio, 1:03:57, \nhttps://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly90cmlhdGhsb250YXJlbnBvZGNhc3QubGlic3luLmNvbS9yc3M/episode/aHR0cDovL3RyaWF0a \nGxvbnRhcmVuLmNvbS8_cD05OTE?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjQsdrL2t7wAhURioQIHRy0CEMQkfYCegQIARAF (both accessed Aug. 8, 2021). \n5 Ant+ was a network protocol like  Bluetooth but with more flexible ways for netw ork devices to connect to each other.

Makl, 2025.\nThis document is authorized for use only by Jackson Makl in Customer Analytics - MARK 6580 Spring 2025 taught by John Gale, Georgetown University from Mar 2025 to May 2025.\n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n  \n Page 3 UV8688 \ncome with BLE technology enabled. The team at Wahoo immediately started researching and developing a new \nBLE system, which included running around the parkin g lot with a MacBook Air strapped to their backs! \nWhen Apple released the iPhone 4S  in October 2011, everyone at Waho o was ecstatic to see that the new \nphone did indeed have BLE technology. Within a couple of months, Wahoo launched a BLE-enabled heart rate monitor, and for one and a half years it was the only BLE-enabled fitness technology in the market. Apple \nstarted selling Wahoo\u2019s products in the Apple store, and all fitness apps starte d using Wahoo\u2019s application \nprogramming interface (API). Wahoo\u2019s sales took off. \nWahoo\u2019s growth \nAs Hawkins\u2019s interest in triathlons grew, he spent more time training inside and bought a CompuTrainer \nindoor bike trainer.7 CompuTrainer had been ma king indoor cycling traini ng equipment since the 1970s. \nHawkins\u2019s first indoor cycling experience was like his introduction to riding outdoors with multiple \nincompatible fitness trainers. The CompuTrainer system was clunky and difficult to use. Unlike his outdoor \ncycling experience, however, there already were several pl ayers in the smart indoor trainer industry. Hawkins \nwas not discouraged. He recalled one of his MBA professors saying that having other players present in the market was a good thing. It showed that ther e was a real and viable  business to be made. \nHawkins and his team realized that most companies in the indoor trainer industry, such as Tacx, made their \nequipment using a closed system. That meant their proprietary software could be used only with their trainer. Wahoo saw an opportunity to build an open system. In 2013, Wahoo launched the Wahoo Kickr as its first \nsmart indoor trainer.\n8 The Kickr came with an open API, and Wa hoo encouraged people to develop software \naround it. Shortly thereafter, numerous computer softwa re and apps started popping up. Some, including Zwift \nand TrainerRoad, would become huge hits. This decision to offer an open system enabled Wahoo to partner with several new software companies. \u201cAs a company we are driven to innovate on fitness technology and leverage workout data so athletes can consistently im prove the way they train and perform,\u201d Hawkins said.\n9 \nCustomers loved it, and the Wahoo Kickr became the ma rket leader. Wahoo built several different products \nand accessories around the Kickr brand, winning awards for top design. The Wahoo Kickr brand continued to hold the top position in the smart trainer market in 2021. In addition to the Kickr brand, Wahoo developed a \nsuccessful cycling product portfolio (see Exhibit 1 ). \nIn 2018, Wahoo received funding from inve stment firm Norwes t Equity Partners\n10 and started to look for \nacquisitions to grow its brand. The following year, Wa hoo acquired pedal manufacturer Speedplay and software \ncompany Sufferfest. Speedplay had a long history of product innovation and grew to become one of the leading \nhigh-performance pedals. It had a similar mission to Wahoo\u2019s\u2014improving the cyclist experience\u2014and fit in \nwell with Wahoo\u2019s product portfolio. Sufferfest was a bit different. Sufferfest was a software product that competed directly with Zwift and Tr ainerRoad, some of Wahoo\u2019s long-term partners. At that time, Zwift \nannounced that it would start to build its own hardware products, including indoor trainers. \u201cWe think that \nSufferfest is different from everything that is out there,\u201d Closs said. \u201cIt un iquely blends content and structured \ntraining workouts in a way that is different from anything else in the industry.\u201d \n7 Outdoor bicycles were attached to these devices enabling riders to train indoors. \n8 An indoor trainer was a product that conne cted to a cyclist\u2019s regular bi cycle to turn it into a stationary bicycle. A smart in door trainer allowed the \ncyclist to connect the trainer to a computer and control the resistance of their pedaling. This allowed for a software to contr ol the bicycle and give the \ncyclist a real simulation of outdoor riding. For example, as a cyclist went uphill within the virtual world, it would become harder for them to pedal at \nhome. \n9 BRAIN Staff, \u201cWahoo Fitness, after Growing 235% in Three Years, Lands on the Deloitte Fast 500 List,\u201d Bicycle Retailer and Industry News, December \n12, 2017, https://www.bicycleretailer.com /industry-news/2017/12/ 12/wahoo-fitness-after-gr owing-235-three-years-la nds-deloitte-fast-500-\nlist#.YTJZSfeSmUl  (accessed Sept. 3, 2021). \n10 John McNulty, \u201cNEP Invests in Wahoo Fitness,\u201d Private Equity Professional , July 26, 2018, https://peprofessional.com/2018/07/nep-invests-wahoo-\nfitness/ (accessed Jun. 13, 2021).

Addi tionally, Wahoo sponsored cycling teams including the \nINEOS Grenadiers, Quick-Step, Bo ra-Hansgrohe, and Alpecin-Fenix.11 Athletes using Wahoo products had \nwon all major races in cycling and triathlon, including the Tour de France, Giro de Italia, Ironman Kona World Championship, and the Olympics.\n12 See Exhibit 2  and a Wahoo YouTube video13 for photos. \nWahoo Fitness Product Overview \nThe company he founde d had come a long way from where Hawkins had started. From the adapter that \nlaunched Wahoo to the move into wearable products with the smartwatch, Hawkins had been intentional about growth and new products. Each of Wahoo\u2019s product offerings could be categorized as hardware or software. Wahoo started as a hardware company, and the majority of its revenue st ill came from the hardware fleet of \nproducts. These included three different categories: indoor cycling, outdoor cycling, and multisport. \nIndoor cycling: Wahoo\u2019s indoor products enabled cyclists to  control and simulate  outdoor conditions, \nproviding a \u201creal ride\u201d experience that navigated between virtual and reality. These products were often used \nto train at home. Professional cyclists also used these products to warm up and cool down before and after \nraces. \nOutdoor cycling : Wahoo\u2019s outdoor products were intended to improve the cyclist\u2019s experience while riding \noutdoors. Its GPS computers tracked and recorded all av ailable data, and it allowed for on-device navigation \nto get the cyclist to where they want ed to go. Wahoo\u2019s proprietary pedal system improved cyclist performance \nand safety. \nMultisport : Wahoo\u2019s multisport products allowed customers to track and record data in a variety of different \nsports. The Elemnt Rival GPS watch focused on triath letes and included specif ic features for runners, \nswimmers, and cyclists. \nOn the software side, Wahoo offered Wahoo Fitness phone apps and acquired Sufferfest\u2019s training \nplatform (see Exhibit 3  for details of Wahoo\u2019s software products). \u201cWe need to increase revenue from our \nsoftware products,\u201d Closs said. \u201cI wo uld like to push more hardware cust omers to software subscriptions and \nincrease customer lifetime value.\u201d Closs didn\u2019t see softwa re as a \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d market. \u201cI don\u2019t see why you \ncan\u2019t subscribe to Sufferfest and Zwift,\u201d he said. \nTo purchase Wahoo products, customers could order directly from Wahoo\u2019s website or through \ninternational distributors, dealers, or retailers in 49 cities worldwide.\n14 In the United States alone, Wahoo \nproducts were available in 214 retailers.15 \u201cWahoo pursues a multilevel sales concept in Europe, working partly \nwith distributors,\u201d Kevin Apt, head of sales, said. \u201cBut in many areas there is reliance on a direct dealer \napproach.\u201d16 Wahoo used a global network of warehouses to distribute its products to more than 97 countries.17 \n11 Fun fact: UVA student and pro cyclist Ed ward Anderson rode for Alpecin-Fenix. \n12 See \u201cWahoo Athletes,\u201d Wahoo Fitness, https://www.wahoofitness.com/athletes  (accessed Jan. 26, 2022) for more. \n13 \u201cWahoo Fitness Case Opener  2021,\u201d YouTube video, 1:14, posted by \u201cDarden ClassVideo,\u201d September 30, 2021, \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7XBE2u0jI8  (accessed Jan. 27, 2022). \n14 \u201cInternational Retail ers,\u201d Wahoo Fitness, https://www.wahoofitness.com/international-dealers  (accessed Sept 7, 2021). \n15 \u201cStore Locator,\u201d Wahoo Fitness, https://www.wahoofitness.com/store-locator  (accessed Sept. 7, 2021). \n16 Gary, \u201cWahoo Fitness Confirms Dedicated Territ ory Manager in Southeast Europe,\u201d Endutance.biz, March 19, 2020, \nhttps://endurance.biz/2020/industry-new s/wahoo-fitness-confirms-d edicated-territory-manag er-in-southeast-europe / (accessed Sept. 9, 2021). \n17 \u201cShipping & Delivery,\u201d Wahoo Fitness, https://www.wahoofitness.com/ shipping-and-delivery  (accessed Sept. 7, 2021).

Emerging technologies such as \nwearable fitness devices and augmented reality had ch anged consumers\u2019 experiences. \u201cWe don\u2019t view Fitbit, \nApple watches, and even Peloton to be much of a competitor,\u201d Closs said. \u201cGarmin\u2019s acquisition of Tacx\u2014 \nour largest competitor in indoor equipment\u2014made it our number one competitor.\u201d Wahoo\u2019s competitors included the following: \nGarmin offered products across a variety of sports catego ries, such as cycling, swimming, and hiking. While \nGarmin traditionally focused on wearables, accesso ries, and GPS tools, its 2019 acquisition of Tacx, a \nmanufacturer of indoor cycling trainers and other c ycling specialty equipment, moved it into the fitness \nsegment. With this acquisition, Garmin moved directly into Wahoo\u2019s largest product category, and the two companies were now competing head-to-head in all categories. Garmin  had strong capabilities and a strong \nstrategic position, with data on endurance athletes,  to step into Wahoo\u2019s space with confidence. \nZwift was one of Wahoo\u2019s major partners. It was a software company that provided an app for indoor \ncycling and running. With the app, users could explore or  compete in races, across the digital world of Watopia \nor within a rotating collection of cities and countryside worldwide. Zwift had not released data on how many users it had, but an estimated 20,000 individual us ers visited its platform each day, and 120,000 people \nparticipated in the 2020 Tour de Zwift event.\n18 The app connected to a variety of hardware, embracing an open-\naccess strategy similar to Wahoo\u2019s, and Wahoo products could be purchased on the Zwift website. \u201cIf consumers use Zwift but have a whole Wahoo hardware setup,\u201d Closs said, \u201cwe don\u2019t get that data\u2014we give \ncustomers the option to share their data with whoever they want.\u201d In September 2020, Zwift raised $450 million \nat least in part to finance the creation of its own hardware offerings\n19 and employed more than 500 people.20 \nPeloton was an exercise equipment comp any founded in 2013 in the United States. Peloton had seen \nconsiderable growth, especially through the release of its stationary bicycle. The company reduced its bike price \nby $350 in 2020, and revenue from th at segment increased 169.7% by June 2021.21 It had over 6,500 \nemployees.22 In addition to the hardware, the company had its own community software that distributed \ncontent such as instructional videos and live exercises. Subscription reve nues jumped from $80.3 million in \n2018 to $363.7 million in 2020.23 While Peloton\u2019s focus on hardware and content was similar to Wahoo\u2019s, its \ntargeted market segment was considerably different. \nApple, Samsung, and Google . While these tech companies might not seem like competitors at first glance, they \ndid make subtle moves into the endu rance sport market. With the introd uction of the Apple Watch in 2015, \nApple entered into the wearables market, and it quickly became the top wearables seller. While the watch wasn\u2019t \nmarketed specifically for athletes, Apple had been developing features to make it more appealing for athletic activities. With the ability to track real-time workout data, built-in workout tracks, and different exercise \nroutines for swimming, running, and cycling, Apple pos itioned itself as a real competitor in the space. \n18 Gary, \u201cZwift by Numbers: 120K Take on the 2020 Tour de Zwift,\u201d Endurance.biz, February 21, 2020, https://endurance.biz/2020/industry-\nnews/zwift-by-numbers-120k-take-on-the-2020-tour-de-zwift/  (accessed Jun. 13, 2021). \n19 \u201cZwift Plans to Offer Its Own Hardware Following $450 Million Investment,\u201d Bicycle Retailer and Industry News , September 16, 2020, \nhttps://www.bicycleretailer.com/ industry-news/2020/09/ 16/zwift-plans-offer-its-own-indoor-bike-fo llowing-450-million-\ninvestment#.YEZisdxOlEY  (accessed Jun. 13, 2021) \n20 Nat Rubio-Licht, \u201cSetting the Pace: Silicon Beach Play ers Are Paving the Way for Post-Pandemic Workplaces,\u201d Los Angeles Business Journal, June 28, \n2021, https://labusinessjournal.com/news/2021/jun/28/tech -companies-pave-way-post-pandemic-worksplaces/ (accessed Sept. 30, 2021). \n21 Peloton SEC Form 10-K, 2021. \n22 Peloton SEC Form 10-K, 2021. \n23 \u201cAnnual Subscription Revenue of Peloton Wo rldwide from 2017 to 2020,\u201d Statista, https://www.statista.com/s tatistics/1203061/peloton-\nsubscription-revenue/  (accessed Sept. 9, 2021).

Other smaller players in the field competed on several different angl es. Polar (with 1,200 \nemployees),24 Suunto (with 400 employees),25 and Coros all played in the crowded GPS sport watch category. \nWith approximately 500 employees,26 Whoop offered a wearable product and accompanying app focused on a \nmore holistic health profile, including sleep and stress. There were also plat forms such as Strava, with over 275 \nemployees,27 that created a social media space for exercise enthusiasts. \u201cStrava is a super important partner and \nis the most widely used platform by our customers,\u201d Closs said. The fitness techno logy space was complex and \ncrowded. \nThe COVID-19 pandemic did present Wahoo with an interesting competitive twist. Wahoo was better able \nthan its competitors to take advantage of a surge in dema nd, as the strong manufacturing relationships it already \nhad in place enabled it to scale up  faster. This led to a market sh are increase for indoor trainers. \nWahoo Expansion Options \nBy focusing on the \u201ctip of the spear\u201d cyclist, Waho o had created a dominant br and within the \u201chardcore\u201d \ncycling segment. \u201cWahoo doubled down on what we do we ll\u2014avid cyclists and endurance athletes,\u201d Closs said. \n\u201cFor us it is all about the ecosystem of our products and how they work together.\u201d Yet growth potential within \nthis niche segment was limited. With the launch of the El emnt Rival watch, Wahoo officially expanded into the \ntriathlete\u2019s segment. This was a logical next step give n the overlap of triathlon and cycling. Many triathletes \nalready used Wahoo\u2019s cycling products. Thinking about expansion, Closs and his team looked at three areas \nthat could be good fits for Wahoo: \nSpinning : Led by Peloton, there had been a massive increase in the popularity of spinning classes from home. \nWahoo had the technological expertise in developing in door cycling equipment, an d it could easily develop \nproducts catered to that market. There was, howe ver, a big difference between Wahoo\u2019s and Peloton\u2019s \ncustomers. Peloton customers were more focused on ge neral fitness, while Wahoo customers were preparing \nfor their next race. Moreover, Wahoo lacked the media co ntent that Peloton had created with its professional \ninstructors. Spinning presented an opportunity to reach a larger audience (expected to grow from $508.9 million \nto $623.8 million in 2026),28 but it could also damage the branding Wahoo had successfully built around the \ncompetitive cyclist. \nRunning : The Wahoo Elemnt Rival watch presented the opportunity to expand into running, a much larger \nsegment than cycling. The Rival watch already included the basic technology tools that runners needed. The drawback was that many runners didn\u2019t know about the Wahoo brand. Additionally, running was a segment \nwith fierce competition and many established player s such as Garmin, Apple, and Fitbit. Could Wahoo \ndifferentiate from competitors? Would us ing the same \u201ctip of the spear\u201d strategy work to develop new products \nand features for runners? \nExisting customers : Another growth strategy would be to continue to focus on its existing customers\u2014 \npassionate cyclists and triathletes\u2014but with new prod ucts and services. This could include entering new \nhardware product categories, expandin g existing hardware categories, or developing new software content, \nfeatures, and metrics to grow recurr ing software sales.

However, developing new content and software \nfeatures would require building out several capabilities within the company. For example, training software \nprogram recommendations on Wahoo\u2019s Systm app29 could be further personalized based on customer training \ndata but would require Wahoo to invest in data science capabilities for algorithm development. In terms of \nhardware, new versions of watches, heart rate monitors, and other GPS products could be developed \nspecifically for triathletes. Industry-wid e trends pointed to new tracking devices in the form of bracelets, rings, \nor glasses. Some in the industry were exploring clothing items such as smart shirts, sh oes, socks, hats, or pants \nthat could track athlete performance.30 \nConsumer Survey \nTo keep pace with competitors as well as grow beyond them, Wahoo had several areas to consider. \nCustomers wanted easy-to-use devices, innovation, and functionality. Additionally, \u201cwe want to create a more \nseamless experience,\u201d Closs said. Wahoo collected produc t, website, and social media data. \u201cWe leverage data \non our apps to better understand our customers and to crea te better products,\u201d Closs said, \u201cand do better cross-\nselling.\u201d As the team considered growth, Wahoo decide d to conduct a survey to g ather data and ultimately \nimprove its strategy, consumer targeting, marketing plans, and innovation pipeline. Closs and his team hoped to use insights from the survey to assist Wahoo in decidi ng where to expand next. Mo re specifically, objectives \nof the research included the following: \n\uf0b7 Understand sizing, targeting, and profiles of the different consumer types that \u201clive an active lifestyle\u201d \n\uf0b7 Define consumer types that have highest potential for Wahoo \n\uf0b7 Understand behaviors, product usage, and attitudes of existing and potential Wahoo consumer types \nThe survey used two different data sources. The firs t was 250 Wahoo users identifi ed via the Wahoo owners \nmailing list. The second was 400 random  people identified by a third-part y consulting company. The survey \nparticipants had to fit the following criteria: \n\uf0b7 Perform at least some sport activity regularly each week \n\uf0b7 Spend at least $100 on sports in last 12 months \n\uf0b7 Age: 18\u201365 years old \n\uf0b7 Gender: Maximum 300 participants either gender \n\uf0b7 Cyclist quota: 100 respondent s (few times a month) \n\uf0b7 Runner quota: 100 respondents (1\u20134 hours per week) \n\uf0b7 Triathletes quota: 50 respondents (few times a month) \n\uf0b7 Indoor bike training  quota: 100 respondents \n29 The Systm app was a rebranded up date of an app on The Sufferfest, which Wahoo had acquired: Michelle Arthurs-Brennan, \u201cWahoo S ystm absorbs \nThe Sufferfest into a New More Corporate App (and You Should Absolutely Check It Out),\u201d Cycling Weekly , September 28, 2021, \nhttps://www.cyclingweekly.com/products/wahoo-sy stm-absorbs-the-sufferfest-into-a-new-mor e-corporate-app-and-you-should-absolute ly-check-it-\nout (accessed Jan. 27, 2022). \n30 For examples of these products see Ambiot ex, Owlet, and Sensoria, \u201cConnected Wearable Device Market in Healthcare, Wellness, a nd Fitness \nMarket Outlook and Forecasts 2021\u20132028,\u201d Mind Commerce, January 2021, https://www.researchandmarkets.c om/reports/5232537/connected-\nwearable-device-market-in-healthcare  (accessed Sept. 7, 2021). For the exclusive use of J. Makl, 2025.\nThis document is authorized for use only by Jackson Makl in Customer Analytics - MARK 6580 Spring 2025 taught by John Gale, Georgetown University from Mar 2025 to May 2025.\n\n  \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Page 8 UV8688 \nThe survey included two sets of questions about the customers\u2019 attitudes and behaviors, as shown in \nExhibit 4 . Additionally, the survey indicated several facts ab out each customer, such as gender, age, sports \npracticed, and equipment used during activity. See Exhibit 5  for the segmentation process. \nSegmentation profiles \nThere were several different segments within the Wahoo customer survey data, and some had little variance \nbetween them. There were, however, three distinct profile classes, which the Wahoo team labeled \u201cCompetitive \nCasey\u201d (36% of data), \u201cSocial Sean\u201d (28% of data), and \u201cLeisure Logan\u201d (35% of data). All three shared \ncommon characteristics, such as they had practiced their sport(s) for over three years, they tracked and used data to measure their performance, and they were knowledgeable about their sport equipment. See Exhibit 6 \nfor profiles. \nThe differences among the three main profiles offered insights into who spent more money on their \nsporting equipment. Another pattern showed that women tended to be more likely than men to participate in leisure sport activities (52%), rather than competitiv ely (22%) or socially (19%). Regardless of type of \nparticipation, sports activities were more prominent among those between the ages 30 and 49 across all profiles, and on average spinning was popular. As the Wahoo team examined the qualitative research results, they recognized how useful it was for understanding of th e range of possible segment solutions and how segments \ncompared to each other. See Exhibit 7  for comparisons across profiles. \nWhere to Go from Here? \nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic was a tragedy that impa cted humans worldwide, for the fitness industry, \nit had a small silver lining. Lockdowns and isolation dr ove an increased interest in cycling, opened people up \nto the benefits of exercising at home, and heightened th e importance of mental and physical health for many \nindividuals. More customers wanted in -depth tracking data that encompassed more components of their lives, \nas well as more interactive and social fitness experi ences. The shift in indust ry dynamics highlighted \nopportunities and attracted capital that allowed many companies to pursue expansion through product \nofferings. Moreover, it opened doors for new entrants. \nWahoo was in the same position. Many of the pandemic-induced changes drove success in the short term \nfor Wahoo. It also brought up the question of where to expand next. Should the company move beyond \u201chardcore\u201d cyclists and triathletes to capture more of  the mainstream fitness-cons cious Peloton users? Should \nWahoo extend into the running segment with its new GP S watch? Or should it launch new software features \nand hardware products to target existing customers? Or something else? Closs an d his team would use the \nsurvey results as a starting point to better understand  who Wahoo consumers were, or might be, as they tailored \nstrategies around product offerings.
